### Motivation
I recently completed a project where I used C++ to make a 3D 
graphics engine from scratch using the graphics api, Cinder.
I've been learning rust for a little bit, and wanted to apply
what I've learned to start getting into using rust and
webassembly. I find games to be some of the most fun and
rewarding types of projects, and because this is for my learning
only, I figure it'd be perfect.

### Progress
- Started learning about WebGL
- Started playing around with some boiler plate setup
- Struggled to understand WebGL and boiler plate setup
