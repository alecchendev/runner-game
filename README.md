# 3D Platform Runner

![demo](runnerGame.gif)

### Description
A first-person 3D platformer where you race others to traverse a course using a spiderman-grappling-hook-esque ability.
Using Rust, WebAssembly, Javascript, and WebGL, I've built the game in it's current state without using
a game engine. I'm using this project to throw myself into graphics, lower-level programming, and game dev, and
it's worked out pretty well so far.
